Build a FastAPI-Driven Blockchain Voting System with Facial Verification using basic technologies suitable for a university final year project.

🧩 Project Requirements

Backend Framework: FastAPI (Python)

Database: SQLite (use SQLAlchemy or sqlite3)

Facial Recognition: OpenCV + face_recognition library

Blockchain: A simple custom Python blockchain to store votes securely

Frontend: Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates (use Jinja2)

Server Port: Runs on http://localhost:8000

⚙️ Core Features

Voter Registration:

Register a voter with name, ID, and captured face.

Save the face encoding in the database.

Face Verification:

Before voting, the voter’s face is verified using a webcam snapshot.

Voting Process:

Verified voters can cast a vote for a candidate.

Each vote is stored as a block in a simple blockchain (with hash, timestamp, and voter ID).

Admin Dashboard:

View all voters and candidates.

Display blockchain records (blocks, timestamps, previous hash).

Show total votes per candidate.

📡 API Endpoints

POST /api/register → Register voter and save face encoding

POST /api/verify-face → Verify voter face before voting

POST /api/vote → Cast vote (adds to blockchain)

GET /api/chain → View blockchain data

GET /api/results → Get total votes per candidate

🧰 Dependencies
fastapi
uvicorn
sqlalchemy
opencv-python
face_recognition
jinja2

🧠 Expected Output

A running FastAPI app on Replit that:

Lets voters register and verify using face recognition

Allows secure voting through blockchain

Displays results and blockchain in admin dashboard

Instructions for AI:
Generate the full working project code with clear comments.
Include example data and step-by-step setup instructions (how to run in Replit).
Make sure the code runs locally using:

uvicorn main:app --reload


Use only simple Python, HTML, and CSS — no advanced frameworks like React or Docker.
